	The Question of Evaluation

	How do we know that the reference immutability system is correct, safe, and practical?

	Steps (not necessarily in linearized order):
	*. Implement DOTjs.
	*. Implement annotation systems for RI and purity in DOTjs. Speculate about complier extensions.
	*. Show that DOTjs maps to DOT.
	*. Show that the RI annotation system is sound.
	*. Show how common Scala idioms translate to DOTjs.
	*. Show how the idioms may be annotated in DOTjs. (and possibly: how those annotations map back to Scala.)
